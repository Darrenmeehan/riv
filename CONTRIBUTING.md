# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via Github issue. Remember to search for existing issues that might already address the issue.

Please note we have a generic code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

The main thing to bear in mind, is that all Pull Requests should be made against the Development branch, not master, as the master branch will be reserved for releases. 

## Pull Request Process

The ultimate aim for this project, more than being a useful piece of software, is to be a great place for rust and open-source beginners to get involved. Where possible we will try to label issues with the easy label and the help wanted label. Generally, the issues will be as detailed as we can be, and if clarification is required, we will do our best to do so. 

1. Please post a remark on the issue you are going to work on to say that you are taking that issue. 
2. The maintainers of the project will merge any PRs that have passed QA/Code Review.
